            <p>
              This free service allows software developers to scan websites for
              Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes.
            </p>

            <p>
              JavaScript and CSS stylesheet assets can be protected with
              cryptographic hashes to prevent tampering with these assets on
              their way to the website visitors.
            </p>

            <p>
              SRI hashes can protect visitors from browser exploits, denial of
              service attacks, cookie stealing and other harmful actions.
            </p>

            <h2 class="ui header">The Benefit of CDNs</h2>
            <p>
              Website developers tend to trust Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
              to host some of their website assets such as JavaScript and CSS.
              Third-party CDN services such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/">Google</a>,
              <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com">jsdelivr</a> or <a href="https://cdnjs.com">cdnjs</a>,
              offer to host assets close to the website visitors.
            </p>

            <p>
              The benefit of using CDNs to visitor experience is great.
              Providers host the assets from datacenters around the globe with
              good network connections. As a result, webpages load quicker into
              the visitors' browsers. Also, the uptime of a typical CDN is
              <a href="https://www.cdnperf.com/">close to 100%</a>.
            </p>

            <h2 class="ui header">The Problem with Hosted Assets</h2>
            <p>
              However, there is a lot of trust involved here. JavaScript and
              CSS stylesheets can be abused to
              <a href="https://blogs.sophos.com/2015/07/21/a-closer-look-at-the-angler-exploit-kit/">exploit browsers</a>
              <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/04/ddos-attacks-that-crippled-github-linked-to-great-firewall-of-china/">DDoS websites</a>,
              and steal cookies from the visitors. Software developers assume
              these third-parties will never replace the hosted assets with something
              malicious. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Great Firewall of China <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2015/04/chinas-great-cannon/" target="_blank">
              has injected extra code</a> into JavaScript assets on Baidu's CDNs.
              The additional snippet was instructing the browser of unsuspecting
              website visitors to DDoS GitHub servers.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another example is from 2014, where <a href="http://www.net-security.org/malware_news.php?id=2869">
              jQuery's CDN was compromised</a> according to RiskIQ. Although
              jQuery <a href="https://blog.jquery.com/2014/09/24/update-on-jquery-com-compromises/">did not confirm
              </a>the unauthorized modification of the hosted library, the case
              highlights the problem with blind trust in these third-parties.
            </p>

            <h2 class="ui header">Trust, but Verify</h2>
            <p>
              The solution to confirm the integrity of third-party assets with
              cryptographic hash named Subresource Integrity (SRI) hash.

              This hash format has been standardized by
              <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/">W3C</a> and function similarly to
              the well-known MD5 or SHA hashes.
            </p>

            <p>
              To protect third-party hosted assets is relatively straightforward.
              First, we need to generate the SRI hash of the asset. Then we append
              calculated SRI values to the asset tags like the following:

              <pre><code class="hljs html">&lt;script src=https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js<br>integrity=&quot;sha256-ImQvICV38LovIsvla2zykaCTdEh1Z801Y+DSop91wMU=<br>sha384-8gBf6Y4YYq7Jx97PIqmTwLPin4hxIzQw5aDmUg/DDhul9fFpbbLcLh3nTIIDJKhx<br>sha512-AFwxAkWdvxRd9qhYYp1qbeRZj6/iTNmJ2GFwcxsMOzwwTaRwz2a/2TX225Ebcj3whXte1WGQb38cXE5j7ZQw3g==&quot;<br>crossorigin=anonymous&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
            </p>

            <p>
              When the website visitor's browser downloads the remote asset from
              the CDN, the browser will verify the hash listed in the tags.
            </p>

            <p>
              If someone has tampered with the asset either at the CDN provider or
              along the way on the network, the browser will not execute the
              JavaScript or CSS stylesheet.
            </p>

            <h2 class="ui header">Summary</h2>
            <p>
              SRI is a great addition to website security. Malicious JavaScript
              and CSS code can be dangerous to website visitors.
              SRI hashes adds an additional layer of protection
              to the integrity of these assets, especially when they are hosted
              at CDNs.
            </p>

            <p>
              The reason <a href="https://sritest.io">sritest.io</a> was born
              is to foster the implementation of SRI. I encourage
              every website developer to consider adding SRI hashes to each
              supported asset.
            </p>
